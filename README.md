## GNR 638 Course Project: Neural Super Sampling

We run this script under [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 2.0.

- In this project we attempt to upscale an image by a factor of 4 times
- This repo consists of two approches: **SRGAN** and **Improved SRGAN (ESRGAN)**

# RUN
- Upload your Low resolution image in `SRGAN/test/input` and high resolution output will be generated in `SRGAN/test/output` (similar procedure goes for ESRGAN)
- Start training: `python train.py`
- For testing: `python test.py`
- `model.py` consists of the SRGAN model code
